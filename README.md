# ebola-data


Data on ebola includes data collected from the WHO, local Health Ministries and Government sources in Liberia, Guinea, Sierra leone,
Mali, Senegal and Nigeria. The dataset includes reported cases of deaths caused by the Ebola virus, suspected cases, new cases and 
probable cases.

The first exploratory analysis done had much to do with cleaning and trimming the data set and aggregating the deaths in order
to plot a time series.

After the time series was plotted, the main analysis done was the exponential forecast smoothing, using the HoltWinter method.
It was used to get a predicted fit of the data and forecast new deaths caused by Ebola for a year.
